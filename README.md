# twilio-integration
an integration that connects Now (now Vercel) to Twilio - it's very rough :-)

This was a hackathon submission I did for Zeit's Global Hackathon
It was a hackathon for their integration platform. 

I decided to integrate with the Twilio API. 

The functionality:
1. Give me your Twilio API ID and Secret
2. I'll give you back a code sample, in the language of your choosing, so you can start sending texts through the Twilio API. 

I don't know how useful it is :-)
